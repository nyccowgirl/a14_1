 Assignment 14.1
 
 Write a recursive function named reverseWithinBounds that has an argument that is an array
 of characters and two arguments that are bounds on array indices. The function should
 reverse the order of those entries in the array whose indices are between the two bounds
 (including the bounds). For example, if the array is:

 a[0] == 'A' a[1] == 'B' a[2] == 'C' a[3] == 'D' a[4] == 'E'

 and the bounds are 1 and 4, then after the function is run the array elements should be:

 a[0] == 'A' a[1] == 'E' a[2] == 'D' a[3] == 'C' a[4] == 'B'

 Embed the function in a program and test it. After you have fully debugged this function,
 define another function named reverseCstring that takes a single argument that is a C
 string and modifies the argument so that it is reversed. This function will include a call
 to the recursive definition you did for the first part of this project, and need not be
 recursive. Embed this second function in a program and test it. Turn in only this final
 result (with output, of course).
